# Digraph-Analyzer
## Overview
This C++ project, titled 'Digraph Analyzer,' is designed for the analysis and manipulation of directed graphs (digraphs). It includes functionalities such as traversal, path finding, and graph statistics calculation.

## Features
- Analysis of directed graphs (digraphs) through various algorithms.
- Implementation of graph traversal techniques.
- Functions for calculating specific properties of digraphs.

## Files
- `digraph_analyzer.cpp`: The main file that orchestrates the graph analysis processes.
- `digraph_functions.cpp`: Contains implementations of various graph-related functions.
- `digraph_functions.h`: Header file for the graph functions, defining the interfaces.
- `Makefile`: Facilitates easy compilation of the project.
- `input.txt`: Sample input file containing digraph data.

## Tech Stack
- C++

## Libraries/Dependencies
- Standard C++ libraries.

## Installation
```
